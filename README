Here's the explanation of what scripts to run in order to see the results

Part 1: part1_data_preprocessing.py
Part 2: part2_ekf_pipeline.py
Part 3: part3_run_step_method.py

The remaing scripts are either build-up to the aforementioned main scripts or unused.

All outputs are stored in separate folders as follows:

Part 1: figures
Part 2: plots
Part 3: plots_step

For Part 2 and 3, there should also be numerical results being printed out and stored in CSV files.
